                         <h4 id="scrollspyHeading1">Basic of Computer</h4>
                          <p>The first computers were used primarily for numerical calculations. However, as any information can be numerically encoded, people soon realized
                             that computers are capable of general-purpose information processing. Their capacity to handle large amounts of data has extended the range and 
                             accuracy of weather forecasting. Their speed has allowed them to make decisions about routing telephone connections through a network and to control
                              mechanical systems such as automobiles, nuclear reactors, and robotic surgical tools.</p>
                            <h4 id="scrollspyHeading2">Analog Computer</h4>
                            <p>Analog computers use continuous physical magnitudes to represent quantitative information. At first they represented quantities with 
                                mechanical components (see differential analyzer and integrator), but after World War II voltages were used; by the 1960s digital 
                                computers had largely replaced them. Nonetheless, analog computers, and some hybrid digital-analog systems, continued in use through
                                 the 1960s in tasks such as aircraft and spaceflight simulation.</p>
                            <h4 id="scrollspyHeading3">Digital computers</h4>
                            <p>In contrast to analog computers, digital computers represent information in discrete form, generally as sequences of 
                                0s and 1s (binary digits, or bits). The modern era of digital computers began in the late 1930s and early 1940s in the United States,
                                 Britain, and Germany. The first devices used switches operated by electromagnets (relays). Their programs were stored on punched
                                  paper tape or cards, and they had limited internal data storage. For historical developments, see the section Invention of the 
                                  modern computer.</p>
                            <h4 id="scrollspyHeading4">Mainframe computer</h4>
                            <p>During the 1950s and ‚Äô60s, Unisys (maker of the UNIVAC computer), International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), and other companies
                                 made large, expensive computers of increasing power. They were used by major corporations and government research laboratories, typically
                                  as the sole computer in the organization. In 1959 the IBM 1401 computer rented for $8,000 per month (early IBM machines were almost 
                                  always leased rather than sold), and in 1964 the largest IBM S/360 computer cost several million dollars.</p>
                            <h4 id="scrollspyHeading5">Supercomputer</h4>
                            <p>The most powerful computers of the day have typically been called supercomputers. They have historically been very expensive and their use
                                 limited to high-priority computations for government-sponsored research, such as nuclear simulations and weather modeling. Today many of the 
                                 computational techniques of early supercomputers are in common use in PCs. On the other hand, the design of costly, special-purpose processors
                                  for supercomputers has been supplanted by the use of large arrays of commodity processors (from several dozen to over 8,000) operating in 
                                  parallel over a high-speed communications network.</p>
                            <h4 id="scrollspyHeading1">Minicomputer</h4>
                            <p>Although minicomputers date to the early 1950s, the term was introduced in the mid-1960s. Relatively small and inexpensive,
                                 minicomputers were typically used in a single department of an organization and often dedicated to one task or shared by a small group.
                                  Minicomputers generally had limited computational power, but they had excellent compatibility with various laboratory and industrial
                                   devices for collecting and inputting data.</p>
                            <h4 id="scrollspyHeading1">Microcomputer</h4>
                            <p>A microcomputer is a small computer built around a microprocessor integrated circuit, or chip. Whereas the early minicomputers
                                 replaced vacuum tubes with discrete transistors, microcomputers (and later minicomputers as well) used microprocessors that 
                                 integrated thousands or millions of transistors on a single chip. In 1971 the Intel Corporation produced the first microprocessor,
                                  the Intel 4004, which was powerful enough to function as a computer although it was produced for use in a Japanese-made calculator.
                                   In 1975 the first personal computer, the Altair, used a successor chip, the Intel 8080 microprocessor. </p>
